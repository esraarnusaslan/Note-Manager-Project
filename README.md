<p>
  I used Http endpoints with mockApi in the Note Manager project. 
  In this way, I added new notes with the Post method and ensured that 
  they were stored in the data. I was able to retrieve all the entered 
  notes with the Get method, and with the Delete method, I deleted the
  notes I wanted to delete both from the UI and the backend.
